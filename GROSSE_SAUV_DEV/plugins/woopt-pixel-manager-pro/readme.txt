Track visitors and conversions for WooCommerce Google Analytics Universal, GA4, Google Ads, Meta, Facebook, TikTok, Microsoft, and many more!

== Description ==

This plugin <strong>tracks WooCommerce shop visitors and collects valuable data for conversion optimization, dynamic remarketing and reporting</strong>.

The Pixel Manager is the most complete and flexible solution for implementing pixels of various providers, like Google Analytics (Universal and GA4), Google Ads (formerly Google AdWords) Pixel, Meta Pixel (Facebook Pixel), Microsoft Pixel, TikTok Pixel, and many more.

The Pixel Managers advanced architecture has numerous advantages:

- Data privacy features allow you to achieve the highest level of GDPR (and other privacy) compliance.
- It is very easy to use and easy to understand.
- Filters allow you to modify the output very flexibly and customize it perfectly to your needs.
- Standardized output to all pixels allows a much better apples-to-apples comparison between different providers.
- Payment gateway accuracy report that shows how many conversions are lost due to redirect issues.
- Automatic Conversion Recovery (ACR) feature allows you to recover lost conversions due to redirect issues.
- Its transpiled and optimized JavaScript library ensures compatibility with more than 98% of all browsers that visit your website.

While the setup is as simple as it can get, the pixel engine under the hood is very powerful. It tracks all e-commerce events and implements all advanced pixel features like Meta CAPI (Facebook CAPI) (Pro version), Google Analytics Enhanced E-Commerce, Google Shopping Cart Item Tracking, TikTok Events API (Pro version), and much more. For advanced users, the plugin offers filters that allow them to tweak the output flexibly and fine-tune the behavior for each shop.

<strong>What makes the Pixel Manager unique?</strong>

The unparalleled and high tracking accuracy, the simple user interface, and constant innovation make Pixel Manager the best solution for e-commerce tracking.

For instance, the [Payment Gateway Accuracy Report](https://sweetcode.com/docs/wpm/diagnostics?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=wpm-plugin-page&utm_campaign=pixel-manager-for-woocommerce-docs&utm_content=payment-gateway-accuracy-report#payment-gateway-tracking-accuracy-report) shows how many conversions are lost due to redirect issues. Payment gateway accuracy issues are more common than you might think and the Pixel Manager is the only tracking solution that provides insights into that problem.

And with the [Automatic Conversion Recovery (ACR)](https://sweetcode.com/docs/wpm/features/acr?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=wpm-plugin-page&utm_campaign=pixel-manager-for-woocommerce-docs&utm_content=acr) (premium feature), which helps you recover lost conversions due to redirect issues, the Pixel Manager solidifies its pole position in tracking solutions. There is no other tracking solution that ships that type of feature (yet).

<strong>Security Review</strong>

Although we follow security best practices, we wanted to make sure that we didn't miss anything. So we had the plugin reviewed by [Patchstack](https://patchstack.com/), a security company that specializes in WordPress security.

The summary of their report was: "We were unable to detect any vulnerabilities that would impact the security status of the plugin in a serious way."

<strong>managed Vulnerability Disclosure Program</strong>

We are committed to ensuring the security of our customers and their data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the Pixel Manager for WooCommerce, we encourage you to report it through Patchstack our security partner. Patchstack runs a managed Vulnerability Disclosure Program (mVDP) that helps us receive, triage, and respond to reported vulnerabilities. Patchstack also provides a reward for the responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin directory into your plugin's directory `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Get the Google Ads conversion ID and the conversion label. You will find both values in the Google Ads conversion tracking code. [Get the conversion ID and the conversion label](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9gY3JSrNHU)
4. In the WordPress admin panel go to WooCommerce and then into the 'Google Ads Conversion Tracking' menu. Please enter the conversion ID and the conversion label into their respective fields.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there detailed documentation for the plugin? =

Yes. Head over to this link: [Documentation](https://sweetcode.com/docs/wpm/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=wpm-plugin-page&utm_campaign=pixel-manager-for-woocommerce-docs)

= How do I check if the plugin is working properly? =

1. Turn off any kind of caching and / or minification plugins.
2. Log out of the shop.
3. Turn off any kind of ad or script blocker in your browser.
4. Search for one of your keywords and click on one of your ads.
5. Purchase an item from your shop.
6. Wait up to 48 hours until the conversion shows up in Google Ads. (usually takes only a few hours)

With the Google Tag Assistant you will also be able to see the tag fired on the thankyou page.

= I get a fatal error and I am running old versions of WordPress and/or WooCommerce. What can I do? =

As this is a free plugin we don't support old versions of WordPress and WooCommerce. You will have to update your installation.

= I am using an offsite payment gateway and the conversions are not being tracked. What can I do? =

We don't support if an offsite payment gateway is in use. The reason is that those cases can be complex and time consuming to solve. We don't want to cover this for a free plugin. We do not recommend offsite payment gateways anyway. A visitor can stop the redirection manually which prevents at least some conversions to be tracked. Also offsite payment gateways are generally bad for the conversion rate.

= I've done everything right in the test, but it still doesn't work. What can I do? =

Here is a non-exhaustive list of causes that might interfere with the plugin code.

* Minification plugins try to minify the JavaScript code of the plugin. Not all minification plugins do this good enough and can cause problems. Turn off the JavaScript minification and try again.
* Caching could also cause problems if caching is set too aggressively. Generally don't ever enable HTML caching on a WooCommerce shop, as it can cause troubles with plugins that generate dynamic output.

= I see issues in the backend of my shop. Admin pages get rendered weird, and popups don't go away when I click to close them. How can I fix this? =

You probably have some script or ad blocker activated. Deactivate it and the issues should go away. Usually you can disable the blocker for just that particular site (your WooCommerce back end).

Our plugin injects tracking pixels on the front end of WooCommerce shops. As a consequence scripts of our plugin have been added to some privacy filter lists. The idea is to prevent the scripts running if a shop visitor has some ad blocker enabled and wants to visit the front end of the shop. This is totally ok for visitors of the front end of the shop. But, it becomes an issue for admins of the shop who have a blocker activated in their browser and visit the backend of the shop.

Unfortunately there is no way for us to generally approve our scripts in all blockers for the WooCommerce back end.

Therefore, we recommend admins of the shop to exclude their own shop from the blocker in their browser.

= Where can I report a bug or suggest improvements? =

Please post your problem in the Pixel Manager for WooCommerce Support forum: [Link](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce-google-adwords-conversion-tracking-tag)
You can send the link to the front page of your shop too if you think it would be of help.

= I found a security vulnerability. How do I report it? =

We are committed to ensuring the security of our customers and their data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the Pixel Manager for WooCommerce, we encourage you to report it through Patchstack our security partner. Patchstack runs a managed Vulnerability Disclosure Program (mVDP) that helps us receive, triage, and respond to reported vulnerabilities.

= 0.1.4 =

* Changed the woo_foot hook to wp_footer to avoid problems with some themes. This should be more compatible with most themes as long as they use the wp_footer hook.

= 0.1.3 =

* Changed conversion language to 'en'.

= 0.1.2 =

* Disabled the check if WooCommerce is running. The check doesn't work properly with multisite WP installations, though the plugin does work with the multisite feature turned on.

= 0.1.1 =

* Some minor changes to the code
