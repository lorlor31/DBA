If your WooCommerce store or marketplace (similar to eBay and Amazon) is selling products that have to be shipped from different locations or by different shipping methods then default implementation of WooCommerce Cart might create a lot of confusion to the customers.

<strong>Woocommerce Marketplace Cart</strong> aims to improve customer experience and follows proven design of Amazon, eBay and Shopify by reimplementing cart, checkout and review order pages to display cart contents grouped into packages (visually separate containers) with shipping method selection under them as well as moving Totals into a separate container on the side.

<strong>Woocommerce Marketplace Cart</strong> has responsive design which will work on Desktop and Mobile screens of any size.

Please install our free <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wc-shipping-packages">WooCommerce Shipping Packages plugin</a>  in order to take advantage of <strong>Shipping Packages</strong> feature.
