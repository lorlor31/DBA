Offer separate shipping from multiple vendors by grouping products in the cart into packages, so they can be shipped with different shipping methods.

== Description ==

If your WooCommerce store (similar to eBay and Amazon) is selling products that have to be shipped from different locations (for example products are located in different warehouses or sold by various sellers) or they can only be shipped by different shipping methods, then **WooCommerce Shipping Packages** is what you need.

**WooCommerce Shipping Packages** is the most powerful plugin that arranges products, based on **Group By** rules, into packages.
Each package has its own shipping method selection in the cart and checkout pages. 
You can also limit which shipping methods can be used for packages with different shipping class.

You will benefit from it when using Multivendor Marketplace plugins like WCFM, WCMP, Dokan, WC Product Vendors and it will allow you to better control ability to charge separate shipping per vendor.
